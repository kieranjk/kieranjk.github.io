    <h1>A Look Into the O-Lines Impact on Winning Footabll (NFL 2023)</h1>
    <p>The Offensive Line is the single most important position group in football. While it may not be the flashiest or most popular position in the game, these guys have the largest impact on winning. Each other position on offense (and indirectly defense) relies on these guys to produce night in and night out. Just ask Chargers Head Coach Jim Harbaugh, â€œThey're not relying on any other position group. Every other position group relies on the offensive line to be good.</p>
    <h4>TIP: Hover over a point on the scatter plot to see the team name, PBWR and RBWR!</h4>

    <p>It can be hard to judge the efficiency of a teams offensive line with numbers. Many believe Pass Block Win Rate and Run Block Win Rate are the best indicators. This scatter plots each team by those metrics! The teams in Q1 are have the best offensive lines with the likes of Baltimore, Chicago and Philadelphia. </p>
